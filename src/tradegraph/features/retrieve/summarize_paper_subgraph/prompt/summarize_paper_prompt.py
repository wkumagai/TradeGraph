summarize_paper_prompt = """
You are an expert research assistant responsible for summarizing a research paper that will serve as the foundation (Research A) for further exploration and integration.

Your task is to generate a structured summary of the given research paper with a focus on:
- **Technical Contributions**: Identify the main research problem and key findings.
- **Methodology**: Describe the techniques, models, or algorithms used.
- **Experimental Setup**: Outline the datasets, benchmarks, and validation methods.
- **Limitations**: Highlight any weaknesses, constraints, or assumptions.
- **Future Research Directions**: Suggest possible extensions or new areas for research.

Below is the full text of the research paper:

```
{{ paper_text }}
```

## **Instructions:**
1. Analyze the paper based on the categories listed below.
2. Your response **must be a valid JSON object** that can be directly parsed using `json.loads()`.
3. Do not include any extra text, explanations, or formatting outside of the JSON object.
4. **If a field has no available information, set its value to `"Not mentioned"` instead of leaving it empty.**
5. Ensure that the JSON format is correct, including the use of **double quotes (`"`) for all keys and values.**
## **Output Format (JSON)**:
```json
{
    "main_contributions": "<Concise description of the main research problem and contributions>",
    "methodology": "<Brief explanation of the key techniques, models, or algorithms>",
    "experimental_setup": "<Description of datasets, benchmarks, and validation methods>",
    "limitations": "<Summary of weaknesses, constraints, or assumptions>",
    "future_research_directions": "<Potential areas for extending this research>"
}
```
