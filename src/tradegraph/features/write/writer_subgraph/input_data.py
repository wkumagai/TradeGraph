    "new_method": "Below is the outcome of step 3—our novel method inspired by BTLM‐3B‐8K (the “Base Method”) and the multimodal, edge‐efficient, multi-stage training insights from Megrez-Omni:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nProposed Method: Adaptive Multimodal Instruction and Co-Training (AMICT)\n\nOverview:\nAMICT is a unified, lightweight transformer-based language model that builds on BTLM-3B-8K’s compact, efficient design while overcoming several of its identified limitations. In particular, AMICT addresses (a) insufficient support for instruction-following and task adaptability, (b) limited ability to process and integrate non-textual (multimodal) cues, and (c) challenges in robustly extrapolating long contexts. By drawing inspiration from Megrez-Omni’s multi-stage training and software–hardware co-design, AMICT integrates additional modality-specific modules and an enhanced alignment stage, all while keeping the parameter count low enough for edge deployment.\n\nKey Components and Innovations:\n1. Dual-Stage Multimodal Pretraining:\n • Text-plus-Multimodal Corpus: In addition to training on high-quality textual data (as in BTLM-3B-8K), AMICT is pretrained on a curated, deduplicated corpus that also includes aligned image snippets (e.g., captioned images) and short audio segments. This diversification addresses the original model’s language-only focus, enabling richer contextual grounding.\n • Modular Encoders: While retaining the core transformer architecture with SwiGLU nonlinearity and ALiBi positional embeddings, AMICT integrates lightweight, parallel encoders for images (and optionally for audio). These encoders share learned representations with the text module through cross-modal attention blocks, fostering better context-sharing across modalities.\n\n2. Enhanced Instruction-Tuning and Alignment:\n • Multi-Stage Post-Pretraining Fine-Tuning: Following the initial pretraining stage, AMICT undergoes a dedicated instruction-tuning phase that employs diverse interactive scenarios (including chat, query-answering, and visual instruction following). This stage explicitly teaches the model to adapt its responses when interleaving text with non-text signals.\n • Reinforcement Learning and Web-Aided Feedback: Inspired by Megrez-Omni’s alignment pipeline, a lightweight RL loop (or comparative ranking mechanism) is incorporated. This stage uses web search or rapidly updated knowledge bases to cross-check high-level factuality, helping to mitigate hallucinations and bias that the Base Method exhibited.\n\n3. Dynamic Context Modulation:\n • Extended and Adaptive Context Windows: AMICT inherits the multi-context training approach (using both 2K and 8K token contexts) from BTLM-3B-8K but further incorporates dynamic context modulation modules. These adjust attention distributions based on the semantic “density” of the input, allowing the model to better manage extended contexts beyond its nominal limit.\n\n4. Hardware-Software Co-Design for On-Device Inference:\n • Efficient Inference and Deployment: Following Megrez-Omni’s edge-side design principles, AMICT is optimized for on-device inference. Quantization-friendly architecture and a shared resource scheduling mechanism between its textual and multimodal modules ensure that the model maintains a favorable quality-size ratio (comparable to 7B-class models) while requiring only modest memory footprint, making it suitable for mobile and edge devices.\n\nBenefits and Expected Outcomes:\n• Improved Adaptability: By being tuned on a wider range of instruction-following tasks that include multimodal signals, AMICT is expected to provide more context-aware, accurate, and less biased answers than the base method.\n• Enhanced Multimodal Capabilities: The integration of vision and audio preprocessing modules means that AMICT can interpret and generate content that interleaves text with non-textual input—an advantage for applications ranging from interactive assistants to autonomous on-device systems.\n• Robust Long-Context Handling: The dynamic modulation mechanism ensures better performance even when processing inputs beyond approximately 8K tokens, reducing the degradation seen in long-context scenarios.\n• Edge Deployment Ready: The co-designed hardware-software approach preserves the efficiency gains of BTLM-3B-8K, ensuring that the model remains compact and fast, while extending its functional scope.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nIn summary, Adaptive Multimodal Instruction and Co-Training (AMICT) leverages the compact, efficient architecture of BTLM-3B-8K and infuses it with multimodal pretraining, advanced instruction-following fine-tuning, dynamic long-context regulation, and hardware-aware deployment strategies. This combination not only mitigates the Base Method’s limitations regarding flexibility, modality support, and contextual range but also opens up new applications in interactive, on-device AI.",
    "verification_policy": "Below are three realistic, Python-implementable experiments we could run to demonstrate AMICT’s superiority over the Base Method:\n\n1. Multimodal Instruction-Following Evaluation\n\n • Goal: Show that AMICT’s added vision (and optionally audio) modules enable better contextual understanding when processing multimodal inputs.  \n • Experiment Plan:  \n  – Build a small benchmark dataset of aligned text + image pairs (e.g., captioned images or visual instructions).  \n  – Implement evaluation scripts (using libraries like PyTorch and PIL or OpenCV) that feed these pairs into both AMICT and the Base Method.  \n  – Measure performance on task accuracy (e.g., correctness of answers or following instructions) and qualitative measures (e.g., how well non-text cues are integrated).  \n • Realism: This experiment can be set up using Python with deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch/tensorflow) along with image processing libraries. Data augmentation and evaluation metrics (such as BLEU score for text outputs or custom metrics for multimodal accuracy) can be computed with standard packages.\n\n2. Long-Context Handling and Dynamic Context Modulation Test\n\n • Goal: Demonstrate that dynamic context modulation in AMICT leads to smoothly degrading performance as input length grows, and even superior handling when pushed beyond standard context limits.  \n • Experiment Plan:  \n  – Generate or select text tasks (e.g., summarization or question answering) with varying token lengths, especially around the 2K, 8K, and extended (>8K) regions.  \n  – Use Python scripts to feed these long-context inputs into both models, and track metrics such as answer accuracy, coherence, and response latency.  \n  – Include logging of attention distribution patterns if possible to illustrate the effect of dynamic modulation.  \n • Realism: With access to pretrained checkpoints and libraries for tokenization (like Hugging Face’s transformers), it’s straightforward to generate or sample long texts. Evaluation metrics can be computed using existing Python libraries (e.g., nltk or rouge score packages).\n\n3. On-Device Inference and Resource Efficiency Benchmark\n\n • Goal: Validate that AMICT’s hardware-software co-design enables efficient on-device (edge) inference while keeping quality levels comparable to larger models.  \n • Experiment Plan:  \n  – Quantize or optimize both models (where applicable) and deploy a simplified version using Python tools (e.g., PyTorch Mobile or TensorFlow Lite for simulation of edge environments).  \n  – Write benchmarking scripts (using libraries like time, memory-profiler, or even torch.utils.bottleneck) to measure inference latency, memory consumption, and throughput across various input modalities and sizes.  \n  – Compare resource usage and response times with a focus on how AMICT scales compared to the Base Method.  \n • Realism: There are numerous Python packages for profiling memory and runtime performance. Additionally, small-scale simulations of on-device environments can be executed on standard hardware before moving to actual edge devices.\n\nEach of these experiments targets one of the key innovations in AMICT—multimodal integration, dynamic long-context handling, and edge deployment efficiency—and can be implemented and executed using commonly available Python libraries and tools.",
    "experiment_details": 'Below is a detailed description of three experiments—each designed to verify one of AMICT’s claimed advantages over the Base Method. In each case we explain the experimentation goal, design the evaluation process (with example Python code snippets using PyTorch and other common libraries), and detail how the experiment leverages the original research’s specifications (using a BTLM-3B-8K backbone, pretrained on SlimPajama, etc.). You can run these experiments on a development workstation and later on real edge devices where applicable.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Multimodal Instruction-Following Evaluation\n\nGoal:\n• Demonstrate that adding vision (and optionally audio) modules in AMICT improves contextual understanding of multimodal inputs relative to the text-only Base Method.\n\nExperimental Plan:\na. Create or collect a small benchmark dataset. For example, use captioned images (from a publicly available dataset such as COCO captions or manually curated pairs). Each item should contain an image and an aligned text instruction or description.\nb. Prepare a PyTorch-based pipeline where both the AMICT (which integrates an image encoder and the language model) and the Base Method (pure text from a GPT-2 style transformer) can process the input.\nc. Define evaluation metrics that cover both quantitative measures (e.g., BLEU scores on generated text, accuracy on instruction tasks, and matching between image content and text responses) and qualitative measures (manual review, scoring how well visual cues are used).\nd. For implementation, leverage libraries such as PIL (or OpenCV) for image loading and torchvision.transforms for preprocessing. Rely on Hugging Face’s transformers for tokenization and text processing.\ne. Compare outputs from both models by running the same set of image-text pairs through them.\n\nExample Code Snippet:\n------------------------------------------------\n# Import libraries\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom torchvision import transforms\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\n# Define image preprocessor\nimg_transforms = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\n    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],\n                         std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),\n])\n\n# Load and preprocess sample image\ndef load_image(image_path):\n    image = Image.open(image_path).convert(\'RGB\')\n    return img_transforms(image).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dim\n\n# Tokenizer for text input (assume same tokenizer for both models)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")\n\n# Dummy functions to represent model inferences\ndef run_amict(image_tensor, text_input):\n    # This function integrates image and text modalities.\n    # Replace with actual AMICT model inference call.\n    return "AMICT response based on image and instruction."\n\ndef run_base_method(text_input):\n    # Base method does not process the image input.\n    # Replace with actual model inference call.\n    return "Base method response."\n\n# Example usage:\nsample_text = "Describe the content of the image."\nsample_image = load_image("path/to/sample_image.jpg")\nencoded_text = tokenizer(sample_text, return_tensors="pt")\n\nresponse_amict = run_amict(sample_image, encoded_text)\nresponse_base = run_base_method(encoded_text)\n\nprint("AMICT response:", response_amict)\nprint("Base Method response:", response_base)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nData augmentation can be added (e.g., random cropping, horizontal flipping) to test robustness. Quantitative metrics (e.g., BLEU, custom multimodal alignment scores) can be computed via standard libraries (like nltk or SacreBLEU).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Long-Context Handling and Dynamic Context Modulation Test\n\nGoal:\n• Demonstrate that AMICT’s dynamic context modulation mechanism yields robust performance when handling very long inputs, even beyond the standard 8K token limit. The test should document how performance degrades gracefully and even outperforms the Base Method in extended context scenarios.\n\nExperimental Plan:\na. Generate or collect text tasks with varied lengths: short (~2K tokens), standard (8K tokens) and extended (>8K tokens). Tasks such as lengthy summarization or multi-part question answering work well.\nb. Use Hugging Face’s tokenizer (or equivalent from transformers) to prepare inputs. The experiment should vary input lengths systematically.\nc. Run the input through both models and record metrics. Evaluate not only answer accuracy (e.g., factual correctness, completeness) but also response coherence, latency, and ideally inspect internal attention distributions (if available) to assess dynamic modulation.\nd. Log key metrics such as generation time per token, CPU/GPU usage, and compare the attention maps (this can be done via hooks in PyTorch or by configuring the model’s output to return attention weights).\n\nExample Code Outline:\n------------------------------------------------\nimport time\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\n# Assume long_text_generator creates or selects a text sample of a given token length.\ndef generate_long_text(target_tokens):\n    # For demonstration, repeat a basic sentence until the token count is reached.\n    base_sentence = "This is a sample sentence for long-context testing. "\n    repeated_text = base_sentence * ((target_tokens // len(base_sentence.split())) + 1)\n    tokens = repeated_text.split()[:target_tokens]\n    return " ".join(tokens)\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")\n\n# Example function to evaluate a model on long texts:\ndef evaluate_model_on_long_text(model_func, token_length):\n    text_input = generate_long_text(token_length)\n    encoded = tokenizer(text_input, return_tensors="pt")\n    start_time = time.time()\n    response = model_func(encoded)\n    latency = time.time() - start_time\n    # Here you could also compute a metric like ROUGE or factual accuracy.\n    return response, latency\n\n# Dummy functions for model operations.\ndef run_amict_text(encoded_text):\n    # Replace with actual call to AMICT text-generation on long input.\n    return "AMICT generated summary/answer."\n\ndef run_base_text(encoded_text):\n    return "Base method generated summary/answer."\n\n# Testing for different lengths: 2K, 8K, 10K tokens.\nfor length in [2000, 8000, 10000]:\n    response_amict, latency_amict = evaluate_model_on_long_text(run_amict_text, length)\n    response_base, latency_base = evaluate_model_on_long_text(run_base_text, length)\n    print(f"Token length: {length}")\n    print(f"AMICT latency: {latency_amict:.2f} sec | Response snippet: {response_amict[:100]}")\n    print(f"Base Method latency: {latency_base:.2f} sec | Response snippet: {response_base[:100]}")\n------------------------------------------------\n\nOptional: To visualize attention distributions, you can register forward hooks on model layers (if the model supports returning attention outputs). This extra diagnostic can be integrated using PyTorch’s hook system.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. On-Device Inference and Resource Efficiency Benchmark\n\nGoal:\n• Validate that the hardware-software co-design of AMICT provides efficient on-device inference while keeping quality competitive with larger models.\n\nExperimental Plan:\na. Use pretrained checkpoints for both models and apply Python-supported quantization or optimization (for example, dynamic quantization available with PyTorch) to simulate edge deployment conditions.\nb. Implement benchmarking routines that track:\n  – Inference latency (using the time module or torch.cuda.Event for GPU measurements).\n  – Memory consumption (using torch.cuda.memory_allocated() or memory-profiler on CPU).\n  – Throughput (number of inferences per second on a fixed workload).\nc. Deploy a minimal version of the model using PyTorch Mobile or simulate an edge environment using a lightweight framework.\nd. Compare metrics on inputs that include single modality (text only) and multimodal (text+image) cases.\n\nExample Python Code:\n------------------------------------------------\nimport torch\nimport time\nfrom torch import nn\nfrom memory_profiler import memory_usage\n\n# Dummy model class – replace with actual model loading code.\nclass DummyAMICTModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(768, 768)\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(x)\n\n# Suppose we load the AMICT and Base Method models (here simulated by dummy objects)\namict_model = DummyAMICTModel().eval()\nbase_model = DummyAMICTModel().eval()\n\n# Function to simulate inference and measure latency and memory usage.\ndef benchmark_inference(model, input_tensor, iterations=50):\n    # Warm-up\n    for _ in range(5):\n        _ = model(input_tensor)\n        \n    # Measure memory\n    mem_before = memory_usage()[0]\n    \n    start = time.time()\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        _ = model(input_tensor)\n    elapsed_time = time.time() - start\n    mem_after = memory_usage()[0]\n    \n    avg_latency = elapsed_time / iterations\n    memory_used = mem_after - mem_before\n    return avg_latency, memory_used\n\n# Create a dummy input tensor.\ninput_tensor = torch.rand(1, 768)  # Adjust as per your actual model input shape.\n\n# Benchmark both models \nlatency_amict, mem_amict = benchmark_inference(amict_model, input_tensor)\nlatency_base, mem_base = benchmark_inference(base_model, input_tensor)\n\nprint("AMICT Inference Latency (avg): {:.4f} sec, Memory Usage Change: {} MB".format(latency_amict, mem_amict))\nprint("Base Method Inference Latency (avg): {:.4f} sec, Memory Usage Change: {} MB".format(latency_base, mem_base))\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional notes:\n• For a more realistic experiment, use the TorchScript and PyTorch Mobile quantization tools. You might script the model as follows:\n  scripted_model = torch.jit.script(amict_model)\nand then run quantization – consult the PyTorch documentation for converting to a mobile-friendly format.\n• Similarly, you can profile GPU memory more precisely using torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() if running on CUDA.\n• Experiments should be repeated with representative inputs from various modalities (text alone, images paired with text, etc.) to build a complete performance profile.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nEach experiment is designed to target one of AMICT’s key innovations:\n1. Multimodal instruction-following assesses how integrated vision (and optionally audio) modules enable enhanced multimodal situational understanding.\n2. Long-context handling evaluates the robustness of dynamic context modulation as input length increases, using both performance and attention diagnostics.\n3. On-device inference benchmarking verifies that the hardware-software co-design offers efficiency and speed gains, critical for edge deployment.\n\nBy following these detailed experimental setups—and by harnessing standard Python libraries such as PyTorch, transformers, torchvision, and profiling tools—you will be able to replicate the setups described in the original research while verifying that AMICT outperforms the Base Method in the specified aspects.',

Experiment 1 loads (or creates dummy) images and processes paired instructions. Two dummy methods (AMICT and Base Method) generate replies; a bar chart comparing the length of responses is saved in PDF.\n2. Experiment 2 generates long texts with varying token counts (2K, 8K, 10K) and measures latency for each dummy method. A latency-over-token-length plot is saved in PDF.\n3. Experiment 3 simulates on-device inference on dummy models. It benchmarks the average latency and memory usage change and saves a comparison bar chart in PDF.\n4. A test function (test_code_execution) runs quickly to verify that the code executes.\n\nPlease ensure all required libraries are installed before running. This script should serve as a template for setting up experiments that verify the claims of AMICT over the Base Method.',
