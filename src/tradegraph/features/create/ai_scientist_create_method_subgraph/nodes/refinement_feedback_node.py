NOTE: This method has been assessed as NOVEL (confidence: {confidence:.2f}), but there is room for improvement to increase confidence and robustness. Focus your feedback on:

1. **Confidence Enhancement**: How to strengthen the novel aspects to increase assessment confidence
2. **Technical Robustness**: Ways to make the novel contributions more technically sound
3. **Clearer Differentiation**: Better articulation of what makes this method unique
4. **Implementation Sophistication**: More advanced technical details to strengthen the approach
5. **Broader Impact**: Expanding the scope or applicability of the novel approach

Your feedback should help elevate this already novel method to be even more compelling and technically robust.
